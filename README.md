# SCUT-RIFV
This is the official repository of "Study on Reflection-Based Imaging Finger Vein Recognition".

## Dataset
We introduce a new dataset SCUT-RIFV which is the first large-scale Reflective Imaging Finger Vein dataset. The SCUT-RIFV database consists of 32064 finger vein images from 668 fingers of 167 subjects. The SCUT-RIFV database is collected in 5 different illuminations conditions and divided the Natural part with natural light and the OnlyNIR part without natural light. In the Natural part, volunteers would face, turn right, turn left, and back to the natural light source while capturing images to change the illumination direction in images. The OnlyNIR part is collected in a completely enclosed room environment without any natural light, leaving NIR light sources alone.

## Request
The SCUT-RIFV Dataset is publicly available(free of charge) to the research community. Unfortunately, due to privacy reasons, we cannot provide the database for commercial use.

We have made part of the dataset available for download in the repo in order to get a detailed view of this data. Those interested in obtaining the whole SCUT-RIFV Dataset should download [release agreement](https://github.com/SCUT-BIP-Lab/SCUT-RIFV/blob/main/SCUT-RIFV%20Database%20Release%20Agreement.docx), and send by e-mail one signed and scanned copy to (scutbip@outlook.com).
